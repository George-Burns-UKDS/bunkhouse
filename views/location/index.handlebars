            <p>Spread between an ancient fort and modern waterfront, Cardiff has materialised into one of Britains
                leading Cities. It offers an amazing blend of old and new, where modern architecture such as the
                Principality Stadium sits just a stones throw from the iconic medievil castle dating back to the
                3rd century.</p>
            <p>There's a constant buzz as thousands of shoppers decend upon the streets on the weekends, before the
                crowds are drawn in to enjoy the incredible nightlife the capital has to offer with its thriving pubs,
                bars and live music venues.</p>
            <p>Cardiff also acts as a central hub from which you can travel with ease to various surrounding locations
                where you will find the breathtaking valleys or beautiful coastline, offering castles, beaches, ancient
                monuments and so much more.</p>
